    content: `Daniel Wellington watches were originally inspired by a chance meeting
    between founder Filip Tysander and the British gentleman Daniel
    Wellington. Tysander was struck by Wellington's impeccable sense of
    style and in particular his habit of wearing vintage watch faces on
    classic, weathered NATO straps. The first spark of an idea was ignited
    and would soon become the iconic Daniel Wellington watch brand. The
    quintessentially British design features a simple, elegant and
    unencumbered watch face that can be moved across a variety of
    interchangeable NATO and leather watch straps, resulting in a
    versatile piece that can be worn in any way on any day of the week.
    The striped NATO strap was pioneered by the British navy more than 40
    years ago and is featured here in a range of colours. Alternatively,
    the genuine leather straps with silver or rose gold plate take the
    watch up a notch in terms of formality. Browse stunning men's and
    ladies' designs in black, gold, rose, silver and two tone.`,
